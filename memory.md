# Developer Working Memory

## Current Task/Focus (As of: 2023-07-15)

**Goal:** Implement the core components (MemorySystem, TaskSystem, BaseHandler) based on their IDL specifications.

**Current Sub-task:** Fix the TaskSystem.find_template method to correctly handle name collisions between atomic and non-atomic templates.

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/memory/memory_system.py`
- `src/task_system/task_system.py`
- `src/handler/base_handler.py`
- `tests/memory/test_memory_system.py`
- `tests/task_system/test_task_system.py`
- `tests/handler/test_base_handler.py`

**Related IDLs:**
- `src/memory/memory_system_IDL.md`
- `src/task_system/task_system_IDL.md`
- `src/handler/base_handler_IDL.md`

## Recent Activity Log

- **(Previous) Implementation of core components:** Created basic structures for `MemorySystem`, `TaskSystem`, `BaseHandler`.
- **(Previous) Implementation of non-deferred methods:** Implemented non-deferred methods in core components.
- **(Previous) Test implementation:** Created tests for non-deferred methods.
- **(Previous) Bug fix:** Fixed `TaskSystem.find_template` name collision issue.
- **Refactoring `BaseHandler` (Part 1):**
    - Identified `BaseHandler` exceeding module length guidelines (456 lines).
    - Extracted file context retrieval (`_get_relevant_files`) and creation (`_create_file_context`) logic into a new `src.handler.file_context_manager.FileContextManager` class.
    - Updated `BaseHandler` to instantiate and delegate calls to `FileContextManager`.
    - Updated `tests.handler.test_base_handler` fixture and tests to mock `FileContextManager` and verify delegation instead of checking for `NotImplementedError`. Fixed related import issues.
    - **Commit:** `03e2338` (fix: Import FileContextManager in test_base_handler.py)
    - **Note:** Line count reduction in `BaseHandler` was modest (456 -> 435) as removed lines were primarily placeholder comments. `FileContextManager` has 132 lines.
- **Refactoring `BaseHandler` (Part 2):**
    - Extracted LLM interaction logic (`_initialize_pydantic_ai_agent`, `_execute_llm_call`) into a new `src.handler.llm_interaction_manager.LLMInteractionManager` class.
    - Updated `BaseHandler` to instantiate and delegate calls (`_execute_llm_call`, `set_debug_mode`) to `LLMInteractionManager`. Removed direct agent handling (`self.agent`, `_initialize_pydantic_ai_agent`).
    - Updated `tests.handler.test_base_handler` fixture and tests to mock `LLMInteractionManager` and verify delegation/initialization. Removed tests specific to agent initialization within `BaseHandler`. Added tests for `_execute_llm_call` delegation.
    - **Commit:** `5a785c8` (fix: Fix failing tests in test_base_handler.py)
    - **Note:** `BaseHandler` line count reduced (435 -> 303 lines). `LLMInteractionManager` has 166 lines. `FileContextManager` has 132 lines. Refactoring successful in reducing `BaseHandler` size and improving modularity.
- **Reflection & Guide:** Reflected on the refactoring process, identified pitfalls (test brittleness, mocking complexity), and synthesized findings into a new guide `docs/refactor.md`.

## Next Steps

1.  Implement the remaining deferred methods in Phase 2:
    *   `LLMInteractionManager`: `execute_call` (implement actual agent call, result processing, error handling).
    *   `MemorySystem`: `get_relevant_context_with_description`, `get_relevant_context_for`, `index_git_repository`
    *   `TaskSystem`: `execute_atomic_template`, `find_matching_tasks`, `generate_context_for_memory_system`, `resolve_file_paths`
    *   `BaseHandler`: `_build_system_prompt`, `_execute_tool` (Note: `_get_relevant_files`, `_create_file_context`, `_execute_llm_call` are now delegated). Also need to implement conversation history update after `_execute_llm_call`.
2.  Implement tests for the deferred methods once they are implemented/refactored (including tests for `LLMInteractionManager.execute_call`).
3.  Review tool registration logic (`BaseHandler.register_tool`) and how it should interact with `LLMInteractionManager`.
4.  Update documentation (IDLs, rules) if refactoring changes public contracts or introduces new patterns.

## Notes & Context

- Refactoring `BaseHandler` aims to improve modularity and adhere to project guidelines (module length).
- `FileContextManager` encapsulates file context logic.
- `LLMInteractionManager` now encapsulates pydantic-ai agent interaction.
- Tests for `BaseHandler` were updated to reflect the delegation pattern.
- Core components continue to rely on dependency injection.

**Integration with Project Docs:**

You should also add a reference to this `memory.md` file and its purpose in `docs/start_here.md` or `docs/project_rules.md`, perhaps under a section about developer workflow or recommended practices.

Example addition to `docs/start_here.md`:

**9. Developer Workflow & Recommended Practices**

*   **Follow the IDL:** Adhere strictly to the IDL specification (`*_IDL.md`) for the component you are implementing (See Section 3).
*   **Use Working Memory:** Maintain a log of your development progress, current focus, and next steps in `docs/memory.md`. Update it frequently and commit it with your changes. This aids context retention and review. (See `docs/memory.md` for template and guidelines).
*   **Test Driven:** Write tests (especially integration tests) to verify your implementation against the IDL contract (See Section 6).
*   **Commit Often:** Make small, logical commits with clear messages.
*   **Format and Lint:** Run `make format` and `make lint` before committing.
*   **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask for clarification on requirements or design.
