<description>Developer's working memory log for tracking current task, progress, next steps, and context.</description>
# Developer Working Memory

## Current Task/Focus (As of: 2023-07-15)

**Goal:** Implement the core components (MemorySystem, TaskSystem, BaseHandler) based on their IDL specifications.

**Current Sub-task:** Fix the TaskSystem.find_template method to correctly handle name collisions between atomic and non-atomic templates.

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/memory/memory_system.py`
- `src/task_system/task_system.py`
- `src/handler/base_handler.py`
- `tests/memory/test_memory_system.py`
- `tests/task_system/test_task_system.py`
- `tests/handler/test_base_handler.py`

**Related IDLs:**
- `src/memory/memory_system_IDL.md`
- `src/task_system/task_system_IDL.md`
- `src/handler/base_handler_IDL.md`

## Recent Activity Log

- **(Previous) Implementation of core components:** Created basic structures for `MemorySystem`, `TaskSystem`, `BaseHandler`.
- **(Previous) Implementation of non-deferred methods:** Implemented non-deferred methods in core components.
- **(Previous) Test implementation:** Created tests for non-deferred methods.
- **(Previous) Bug fix:** Fixed `TaskSystem.find_template` name collision issue.
- **Refactoring `BaseHandler` (Part 1):**
    - Identified `BaseHandler` exceeding module length guidelines (456 lines).
    - Extracted file context retrieval (`_get_relevant_files`) and creation (`_create_file_context`) logic into a new `src.handler.file_context_manager.FileContextManager` class.
    - Updated `BaseHandler` to instantiate and delegate calls to `FileContextManager`.
    - Updated `tests.handler.test_base_handler` fixture and tests to mock `FileContextManager` and verify delegation instead of checking for `NotImplementedError`. Fixed related import issues.
    - **Commit:** `03e2338` (fix: Import FileContextManager in test_base_handler.py)
    - **Note:** Line count reduction in `BaseHandler` was modest (456 -> 435) as the removed lines were primarily placeholder comments, not extensive code. The new `FileContextManager` contains the extracted logic (132 lines).

## Next Steps

1.  **Refactor `BaseHandler` (Part 2):**
    *   Extract LLM interaction logic (`_initialize_pydantic_ai_agent`, `_execute_llm_call`) from `BaseHandler` into a new `LLMInteractionManager` class (or similar).
    *   Update `BaseHandler` to use this new manager.
    *   Update relevant tests in `test_base_handler.py`.
2.  Implement the remaining deferred methods in Phase 2:
    *   `MemorySystem`: `get_relevant_context_with_description`, `get_relevant_context_for`, `index_git_repository`
    *   `TaskSystem`: `execute_atomic_template`, `find_matching_tasks`, `generate_context_for_memory_system`, `resolve_file_paths`
    *   `BaseHandler`: `_build_system_prompt`, `_execute_tool` (Note: `_get_relevant_files`, `_create_file_context`, `_execute_llm_call` are being handled by refactoring/delegation).
3.  Implement tests for the deferred methods once they are implemented/refactored.
4.  Update documentation (IDLs, rules) if refactoring changes public contracts or introduces new patterns.

## Notes & Context

- Refactoring `BaseHandler` aims to improve modularity and adhere to project guidelines (module length).
- `FileContextManager` now encapsulates file context logic.
- Tests for `BaseHandler` were updated to reflect the delegation pattern.
- The core components (`BaseHandler`, `TaskSystem`, `MemorySystem`) continue to rely on dependency injection.

**Integration with Project Docs:**

You should also add a reference to this `memory.md` file and its purpose in `docs/start_here.md` or `docs/project_rules.md`, perhaps under a section about developer workflow or recommended practices.

Example addition to `docs/start_here.md`:

**9. Developer Workflow & Recommended Practices**

*   **Follow the IDL:** Adhere strictly to the IDL specification (`*_IDL.md`) for the component you are implementing (See Section 3).
*   **Use Working Memory:** Maintain a log of your development progress, current focus, and next steps in `docs/memory.md`. Update it frequently and commit it with your changes. This aids context retention and review. (See `docs/memory.md` for template and guidelines).
*   **Test Driven:** Write tests (especially integration tests) to verify your implementation against the IDL contract (See Section 6).
*   **Commit Often:** Make small, logical commits with clear messages.
*   **Format and Lint:** Run `make format` and `make lint` before committing.
*   **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask for clarification on requirements or design.
