<description>Developer's working memory log for tracking current task, progress, next steps, and context.</description>
# Developer Working Memory

## Current Task/Focus (As of: 2023-07-15)

**Goal:** Implement the core components (MemorySystem, TaskSystem, BaseHandler) based on their IDL specifications.

**Current Sub-task:** Fix the TaskSystem.find_template method to correctly handle name collisions between atomic and non-atomic templates.

**Relevant Files:**
- `src/memory/memory_system.py`
- `src/task_system/task_system.py`
- `src/handler/base_handler.py`
- `tests/memory/test_memory_system.py`
- `tests/task_system/test_task_system.py`
- `tests/handler/test_base_handler.py`

**Related IDLs:**
- `src/memory/memory_system_IDL.md`
- `src/task_system/task_system_IDL.md`
- `src/handler/base_handler_IDL.md`

## Recent Activity Log

- **Implementation of core components:** Created the basic Python class structure, method signatures, type hints, and docstring outlines for the `MemorySystem`, `TaskSystem`, and `BaseHandler` classes based on their IDL specifications.

- **Implementation of non-deferred methods:** Implemented the internal logic for the non-deferred methods of the core components, including:
  - `MemorySystem`: `__init__`, `get_global_index`, `update_global_index`, `enable_sharding`, `configure_sharding`
  - `TaskSystem`: `__init__`, `set_test_mode`, `register_template`, `find_template`
  - `BaseHandler`: `__init__`, `register_tool`, `execute_file_path_command`, `reset_conversation`, `log_debug`, `set_debug_mode`

- **Test implementation:** Created test files for each component and implemented tests for the non-deferred methods.

- **Bug identification:** Discovered an issue in the `TaskSystem.find_template` method where it doesn't correctly handle name collisions between atomic and non-atomic templates.

- **Bug fix:** Fixed the `TaskSystem.find_template` method to correctly handle name collisions by checking the template_index for atomic templates with the same name when a non-atomic template is found by name.

## Next Steps

1. Implement the deferred methods in Phase 2:
   - `MemorySystem`: `get_relevant_context_with_description`, `get_relevant_context_for`, `index_git_repository`
   - `TaskSystem`: `execute_atomic_template`, `find_matching_tasks`, `generate_context_for_memory_system`, `resolve_file_paths`
   - `BaseHandler`: `_build_system_prompt`, `_get_relevant_files`, `_create_file_context`, `_execute_tool`
2. Implement tests for the deferred methods once they are implemented.
3. Update documentation to reflect the implementation details and any design decisions made during implementation.

## Notes & Context

- The implementation follows the IDL specifications closely, with placeholder implementations for deferred methods.
- The core components are designed to work together, with `BaseHandler` depending on `TaskSystem` and `MemorySystem`.
- The implementation includes proper error handling and logging as specified in the IDL.
- The tests verify that the implemented methods behave as expected according to the IDL specifications.
- The `find_template` method in `TaskSystem` now correctly handles name collisions between atomic and non-atomic templates, ensuring that atomic templates are always prioritized as specified in the IDL.

**Integration with Project Docs:**

You should also add a reference to this `memory.md` file and its purpose in `docs/start_here.md` or `docs/project_rules.md`, perhaps under a section about developer workflow or recommended practices.

Example addition to `docs/start_here.md`:

**9. Developer Workflow & Recommended Practices**

*   **Follow the IDL:** Adhere strictly to the IDL specification (`*_IDL.md`) for the component you are implementing (See Section 3).
*   **Use Working Memory:** Maintain a log of your development progress, current focus, and next steps in `docs/memory.md`. Update it frequently and commit it with your changes. This aids context retention and review. (See `docs/memory.md` for template and guidelines).
*   **Test Driven:** Write tests (especially integration tests) to verify your implementation against the IDL contract (See Section 6).
*   **Commit Often:** Make small, logical commits with clear messages.
*   **Format and Lint:** Run `make format` and `make lint` before committing.
*   **Ask Questions:** Don't hesitate to ask for clarification on requirements or design.
