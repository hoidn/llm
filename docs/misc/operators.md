# Task Composition Operators (DEPRECATED)

**Status: Obsolete**

This document previously described the XML syntax for `sequential` and `reduce` operators. These composite task types are no longer defined using XML in the current architecture.

**All task composition and workflow logic (including sequences, mapping/reduction, conditionals, and loops) is now defined and executed using the S-expression DSL.**

Please refer to the S-expression DSL documentation [Link to DSL Doc - TBD] and the Task System documentation for details on how workflows are executed programmatically.

Atomic task definitions remain in XML format, as specified in `docs/system/contracts/protocols.md`.
